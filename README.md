# Jason Do - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I am Jason! I have a business and service background and hold a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Business from the University of Redlands. In addition, I have also completed the TripleTen Data Analysis program and after a year I have developed a strong foundation of and passion for discovering helpful and meaningful insights in data. I am excited and eager to use the analytical and technical skills I have learned from this force as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my coding boot camp, I learned the technical skills to analyze and work with complex databases. I have gained experience in pre-processing data, exploratory analysis, statistical analysis, A/B testing, and machine learning, which I believe will be useful in my role as a data analyst.
